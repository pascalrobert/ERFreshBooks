ERFreshBooks
============

A Project Wonder framework that works with the FreshBooks API (see http://developers.freshbooks.com/docs/).

You need two properties to get it to work:

er.freshbook.api.token : your API token
er.freshbook.api.url : the URL that FreshBooks give you for the API (https://XXXX.freshbooks.com/api/2.1/xml-in)

It's feature incomplete, and it doesn't use OAuth yet.
